# README Generator

## Purpose

This is a simple application to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file.

## Instructions

The user runs "node index.js" in the console. The user will be prompted with questions to create the SVG logo file. The user can select a shape, letters, and colors for the text and shape. After finishing the questions, the console will log "Generated logo.svg" and the SVG file specified by the user's choices will be written in the "examples" folder.
